## Chat Completion API

**Chat Completion API** is the first llmOS product. Think of it like any OpenAI LLM API, but **free**, **reliable**, and **blazing-fast** - 
built on top of cutting edge **OSS LLMs**(should have a list of LLMs or which concrete llm?).

**Right now building LLM apps is not ideal for developers, because:**
- building production apps with LLMs is expensive
- using OSS models is hard and time-consuming 
- black-box APIs can be slow and unreliable

**llmOS API solves this problem with:**
- free & blazing fast API with latest OSS LLMs
- as easy to get started as with OpenAI APIs
- llmOS is open-source first, publishing our code in the near future 

## How can it be free?
