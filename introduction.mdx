## Free, blazing-fast LLM API

**Chat Completion API** is the first llmOS product. Think of it like any OpenAI gpt API, but **free**, **reliable**, and **blazing-fast** - 
built on top of cutting edge **OSS LLMs**.


- Building production apps with LLMs is expensive
- Starting off with OSS models is cumbersome 
- Black-box APIs can be slow and unreliable

llmOS API solves this problem with:
- Free & blazing fast API with OSS LLMs
- As easy to get started as with OpenAI gpt APIs
- llmOS is open-source first, publishing our code in the near future 

## How can it be free?
