## Free, fast & easy to use OSS LLM API

***

**llmOS solves the following problems for devs:**

* Tired of paying too much money on OpenAI API bills? You don't have to anymore as llmOS makes it free.

* Love open-source but don't want to mess around deploying OSS models, scaling and optimizing them? llmOS has you covered.

*llmOS is still in alpha so every user has 500M tokens per month. This will increase as we are scaling up. Please [write](https://discord.gg/38c5cxE4Zb) to us if you already need a higher limit.*

## LLM selection

The first model you can use freely is Mistral-7B which is on bar with GPT-3.5 on many [benchmarks](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/).

We will be adding more LLMs. If you'd like to request a specific LLM, please write on [Discord](https://discord.gg/38c5cxE4Zb).

## Open, permissionless peer-to-peer LLM network

***

Today, AI is like closed intranets of the 90's and owned by only a handful few large corporations. Moreover, there is regulatory capture to stifle open-source AI.

We believe AI should be more like the Internet: an open, permissionless and citizen owned network - that's why we are building llmOS. 

This is also **how llmOS can be free** - think of it as torrents for LLMs. We are in the early phases of building out the network. 

Register your interest to [get early access to the network.](https://discord.gg/38c5cxE4Zb) We will reach out in the coming months as we open the network to early users.
