## 

***

We've been hit by a large OpenAI bill too many times and see it as a universal pain for devs. 

**llmOS solves the following problems:**

- building a production app with LLMs is expensive -> becomes free
- deploying OSS models is hard and time-consuming -> as easy to get started as with OpenAI's APIs
 

*llmOS is still in alpha so every user has 500M tokens per month. Please write to us if you need a higher limit.*

## LLM selection

The first model you can use freely is Mistral-7B which is on bar with GPT-3.5 on many benchmarks.

We will be adding more LLMs. If you'd like to request a specific LLM, please write on [Discord](https://discord.gg/38c5cxE4Zb). 

## Open, permissionless peer-to-peer LLM network

***

Today, AI is like closed intranets of the 90's and owned by only a handful few large corporations. Moreover, there is regulatory capture to stifle open-source AI.

We believe AI should be more like the Internet: an open, permissionless and citizen owned network - that's why we are building llmOS. 

This is also **how llmOS can be free** - think of it as torrents for LLMs. We are in the early phases of building out the network. 

Register your interest to [get early access to the network.](https://discord.gg/38c5cxE4Zb) We will reach out in the coming months as we open the network to early users.
